June 21st 2020 ivtools-2.0.0

Non-backward compatible changes from ivtools-1.2.11:

* Swap "$$" and "$" operators in comterp.  The "$$" operator is now stream() (which matches
  the other double-character stream operators - "..", "**", and ",,") and "$" is now list().

* Reverse the priority of ".." (iterate()) and "**" (repeat()), giving ".." precedence over "**".
  The reason is because ".." is more complex than "**", like multiplication is more complex than
  addition.

* Remove symmax() and symcnt() commands because they were redundant with symid() which accepts
  :max and :cnt keywords.

Other changes;

* remove patches directory, sourceforge102203.xml, aclocal.m4, README.cygwin, README.ivmkcm, and comtop.tgz

* migrated all CHANGES-* files to a CHANGES directory
