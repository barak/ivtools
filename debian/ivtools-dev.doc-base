Abstract: InterViews is a software system for window-based
 applications.  Like most user environments, InterViews is
 object-oriented in that components such as windows, buttons, menus,
 and documents are active elements with inherited behavior. The name
 "InterViews" comes from the idea of a user interface object
 presenting an interactive view of some data. For example, a text
 editor implements an interactive view of the contents of a text file.
 .
 InterViews provides a set of classes that define the behavior of user
 interface objects. We distinguish InterViews classes into two groups:
 protocols and kits. A protocol defines the set of operations that an
 object can perform, such as drawing or handling input. A kit defines
 a set of operations for creating other objects. The idea of a kit is
 also sometimes referred to as an "object factory". Using kits hides
 the details of object construction and subclassing-instancing
 tradeoffs made by the implementation, as well as providing a
 higher-level organizational structure to the system.
