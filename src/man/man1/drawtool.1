.TH drawtool 1
.SH NAME
drawtool \- idraw with extensions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drawtool 
.I -import n ['X-params'] [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
drawtool is an extended version of idraw (originally from the
InterViews 3.1).  Based on the ivtools OverlayUnidraw library, it adds
the following features:
.IP
- double-buffered graphics drawing

- 3d Motif-like menus and buttons

- readable text save/restore

- polygon intersection and clipping tools

- graphical object attribute annotations
.PP
drawtool is derived from idraw, and implements the same set of
pulldown commands and pallette of toolbuttons.  Read the idraw man
page for details on that part of the drawtool user interace.  This
page lists only the extensions to idraw embodied in drawtool.
.PP
drawtool saves and restores documents in a readable text format.  This
allows for manual or programmatic creation of drawtool files.
idraw-format documents can still be imported with the "Import Graphic"
command, and exported with the Print command (both under the File
menu).
.PP
In addition to idraw format, the "Import Graphic" command supports the
importing of encapsulated drawtool files, and the following image file
formats: TIFF, X11 Bitmap, PBM, PGM, and PPM.  Compression via
compress (.Z) and gzip (.gz) is recognized and handled for the script
files themselves and the PBM, PGM, and PPM image formats.
.PP
The "Export Clipboard" command writes the contents of the clipboard
out in idraw or drawtool format.
.PP
Commands have been added to the Edit menu for selecting by attributes
(on the graphic objects) and clipping one polygon against another.
.PP
The View menu has been expanded with zoom and pan commands, plus
commands to hide/show graphics and fix graphic sizes and locations.
In addition the viewer's panning and zooming can be chained to other
viewers, and the pointer device can be put into a continuous
"scribble" mode useful when drawing multilines or polygons.
.PP
The tools have been extended with four tools: Annotate, Attribute,
ClipRect, and ClipPoly.  Annotate brings up a text editor in which
graphic-specific text can be entered and/or edited.  Attribute brings
up a dialog box to create/edit property lists for the selected
graphic.  ClipRect and ClipPoly clip polygons, rectangles, lines, and
multilines if drawtool has been built with the clippoly library
(otherwise just lines and rectangles).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP

format data.
